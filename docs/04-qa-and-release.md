# QA and release

## 1. Preview locally

The reader loads its files as modules and JSON, so it must be served over HTTP; double-clicking `index.html` does not work.

```powershell
cd "<project folder>"
python -m http.server 8090
```

- This computer: <http://127.0.0.1:8090/>, then pick the book (or go straight to `reader.html?book=<id>`).
- iPad on the same Wi-Fi: start with `python -m http.server 8090 --bind 0.0.0.0`, then open `http://<this PC's IPv4 from ipconfig>:8090/`. Allow Python through Windows Firewall on private networks. Offline install needs https, so test that on the live site.

## 2. Automatic checks

```powershell
cd tools/qa
npm install                      # first time only
node check_book.mjs <id>         # checks only
node check_book.mjs <id> --shots # checks + screenshots in books/<id>/reference/qa/
```

The script serves the site itself, and opens the book in Chrome emulating an iPad: 1180 × 820, touch, Retina, with Pencil input sent as pen events. It reports:

| Result | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FAIL no anchor found | A question in `book.json` is missing from `layout.json`. | Fix `extract.anchors` or `fixedAnchors`, then re-run `extract_pages.py`. |
| FAIL no entry in solutions.js | A question has no solution. | Add it, or remove it from `book.json`. |
| FAIL phrase not found | A link's `q` phrase doesn't match the printed words. | Copy the words exactly as printed; a phrase may wrap across lines. |
| FAIL no marked answer part | A link has nothing to point to. | Add `L()`, `lk()` or `[[key|…]]`. |
| FAIL graphic threw / drew nothing | A widget crashed. | Fix it in `widgets.js`. |
| FAIL page error / HTTP 404 | Broken code or a missing file. | Read the message. |
| FAIL Pencil stroke / finger tap | An input regression in the engine. | See [05-engine-notes.md](05-engine-notes.md). |
| WARN continued on an extra sheet | The answer didn't fit its region. | Usually acceptable; try `flow`, box `w` or `minScale` first. |
| WARN shrunk to N % | The text was scaled down to fit. | Acceptable down to about 62 %. |

Exit code 0 means nothing blocks a release.

## 3. Visual pass (screenshots)

Open every `sheet-*.png` and `graphic-*.png` in `books/<id>/reference/qa/` and check:

- [ ] every answer box sits inside its blank space with a margin, and covers no printed text;
- [ ] the controls don't overlap the boxes, the next question or the page edge;
- [ ] the maths renders properly: no raw LaTeX and no red KaTeX errors;
- [ ] review link boxes sit on their words, and the tags stay inside the page;
- [ ] graphics have no overlapping labels, and the question card matches the solution;
- [ ] continuation sheets (if any) carry the page header band and read "Answers continued from page N".

## 4. iPad checklist (real device, Apple Pencil)

Run this on the live link after release, or on the local Wi-Fi preview.

- [ ] The library shows the book; tapping the card opens it; the top-left brand returns to the library.
- [ ] Pencil writing starts instantly, with no delay between strokes; a resting palm neither scrolls nor makes marks.
- [ ] One finger scrolls and two fingers pinch-zoom, in every tool.
- [ ] A tap in a box reveals one step; ▸ » ◂ ↺ work; Show all and Hide all work.
- [ ] Dashed review links open and close on tap (finger, or Pencil in Read mode).
- [ ] Every graphic opens, and its slider and buttons respond.
- [ ] Holding still at the end of a stroke snaps it to a line, circle, rectangle or triangle.
- [ ] Tapping ink opens the edit menu (colour, size, Shape, Copy, Delete, move, resize).
- [ ] A two-finger tap undoes and a three-finger tap redoes.
- [ ] Present mode works: full screen, swipe between pages. Only the Exit button leaves; the iPad swipe down (or Esc) only drops full screen, and the next tap restores it. After a two-finger pinch, one-finger drags pan without leaving the zoom; a double tap returns to the whole page.
- [ ] Export PDF opens the share sheet.
- [ ] Rotate the iPad, then close and reopen the app: the ink is still there.

## 5. Release

1. Set `"status": "live"` in `books/<id>/book.json`, and make sure the id is in `books/catalog.json`.
2. Bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` (`ebooks-v5` → `ebooks-v6`). Without this, iPads that already opened the site keep serving the old files.
3. Commit and push:
   ```powershell
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Add <code> <title>"
   git push
   ```
4. Wait about a minute, then confirm the build and the live files:
   ```powershell
   gh api repos/uniplusmathsteam-bot/jm26b-inequalities-ebook/pages/builds/latest --jq .status
   ```
   Open `https://uniplusmathsteam-bot.github.io/jm26b-inequalities-ebook/books/<id>/book.json` to confirm that it's live.
5. On the iPad, close and reopen the app (or the tab) once, so it loads the new version.

**What is public.** The GitHub repo and Pages site are public. `.gitignore` keeps out the PDFs (`*.pdf`, `books/*/source/`) and the reference crops and screenshots (`books/*/reference/`). The page images, solutions and graphics are published.

## 6. Rolling back

- **One bad release:** `git revert <commit>`, then `git push`. Ink saved on iPads is untouched, because it lives in the browser, not in the repo.
- **An aesthetic experiment:** restore from the backup folder made before the change (e.g. `… (backup before review links)`), or `git checkout <commit> -- <files>`.
- **Never** change a live book's `id` or `storage`. The saved ink is keyed by `storage`.
